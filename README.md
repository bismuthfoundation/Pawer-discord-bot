# Pawer-discord-bot
A discord Bot for use with Bismuth cryptocurrency.

## What is it?

Collaborative repo for a discord bot to be run on our Bismuth Discord server: https://discord.gg/C3KdGhP

The specs of this bot are a WIP.  
There probably will be a bounty for a python dev willing to handle the job.

## Technology

Since Bismuth is a full python, from scratch crypto, Python has to be used for constitency.  
Hopefully, a python wrapper for the Discord API exists: https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py

## Specs

WIP  
[Commands list](commands.md)

## Bounty

To be completed.  
Bounty address: 

## Why that name?

For once, it's a word that was never used on our Discord, making it a valuable candidate for a Bot invocation.

Then, it's in memory of Georgius Agricola (1494-1555), known as the Father of minaralogy.  
He latinized many German mining and technical words, like "*Bisemutum*" for the Bismuth element, from the German "*Wismuth*".

"Pawer" Was his german birth name. Nowadays, that would be "Bauer" ;)

So, when you'll get some tip, you'll have a thought for Georg Pawer :D
