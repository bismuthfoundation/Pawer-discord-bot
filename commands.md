# Commands

## Base commands

### info

Base info about Bismuth chain.

Ex: `Pawer info`

### balance

Check your current wallet balance.  
This should work in private chat with the bot as well as in the dedicated Pawer bot channel.

Ex: `Pawer balance`

### deposit

Creates a bismuth address linked to your Discord account and display it.  
Display your current address if already created.

Ex: `Pawer deposit`

**Warning**: It is *not* recommended to use that address as main Bismuth address.  
The team nor the service operator hold no responsability if your wallet or funds are lost.  
This meant to be used for tips, thanks you, quick experiments and other small amount usage.  
The matching wallet private key are stored on a secret online server.
